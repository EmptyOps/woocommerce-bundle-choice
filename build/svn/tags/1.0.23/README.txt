= 1. RING BUILDER =
This ring builder plugin developed to bring to our users all features and flows that are possibly required as per industry standards. We strive to cover all features and flows that are popular in online jewelry & diamond websites. While developing the ring builder feature we have kept in mind all the complexity and challenges that website admins go through like setting up filters and mapping between diamonds and setting mounts is a tiresome task if the backend operations are not developed keeping in mind the ease of use and easy maintenance. [See free Demo](https://demo.bundloice.com/hify-store/design-your-own-ring/)

EVERYTHING RELATED TO JEWELLRY/DIAMOND WEBSITES

The other challenge any website/admin faces is the efficiency given that the complexity of jewelry inventory is a bit challenging to achieve both efficiency and ease of use at both backend and frontend sides. We are happy to say that we have solved this problem very well and excited to avail this plugin to the WooCommerce community. This is only a part of our offering for jewellery & diamond websites, besides ring builder you can benefit from many other features that this plugin offers which make it easier to create jewelry website with little efforts, believe us as long as you have WordPress installed and theme setup all you need is installing this plugin and you will have your jewelry store setup. So in short, if you are building a jewelry or diamond website then we recommend that you take a look at list of features that we offer. [Visit this page to see all different features we offer](https://bundloice.com/jewelry-diamonds-website-package/)

Like said above, anybody who is related to jewellery business does know that jewellery inventory is complex and contains many parameters when it comes to metal or diamonds, we offer tools to make work easier to setup them(with help of sample data) and manage them efficiently. In fact, we have been doing research from time to time regarding the intuitiveness of interfaces as well as backend to easily manage and run say for example Ring Builder and many other modules related to jewellery or diamond websites. We offer fully customizable options with an industry-standard experience, try it and take your site to next level. 

= 2. PAIR MAKER =
If you are related to clothing/fashion website then the Pair Maker feature of BUNDLOICE (formerly Woo Choice Plugin) is something that you may like to know more about and try. Pair Maker feature is the primary feature of BUNDLOICE (formerly Woo Choice Plugin) just like Ring Builder and it works with any WooCommerce websites. To give you an example of pair maker, assume you are selling clothes online then the customer after selecting top-wear is guided for the bottom wear automatically. So if by chance, the user is confused then the plugin guides by recommending different alternatives from the available products catalogue on your site and thus pair of clothing is created for the customer. This feature is useful also when assume that users have good knowledge of color matching but this feature can guide them to choose appropriate pattern and style of bottom wear or vice-versa. This feature is indirectly furnished to bring the traditional salesman approaches to sell more, this is worth trying once. The pair maker feature will also be useful for you if you have anything that you think can be sold in a pair like fashion, apparel, household items – anything, etc. For details on setup see the installation tab above it’s easy to setup and get started. [See a Demo](https://demo.bundloice.com/yc_textile/)

= 3. BONUS FEATURES = 
= 3.1 FILTERS FOR SHOP/CATEGORY PAGE =

There are a variety of alternate widgets to create differently styled horizontal filters, it is mobile responsive, you may like to have a look at the [demo](https://demo.bundloice.com/hify-store/product-category/eo_diamond_shape_cat/)(make sure to check other applicable demos in the demo section below). 
 
If you are looking to create an independent diamond feed page kind of like you would have seen on many sites or if you want to create a product feed page with nice looking filters(you should see related demos in the demo section below) then this feature is for you.

KEYPOINTS:
  * Filter by any WooCommerce Attribute 
  * Filter by any WooCommerce Category
  * Filter by any WooCommerce Product Price

Options UI feature of BUNDLOICE (formerly Woo Choice Plugin) is a key product addons tool for WooCommerce sites. BUNDLOICE (formerly Woo Choice Plugin) offers a wide range of variation swatches widgets like buttons, dropdowns, dropdowns with icons and of course icon swatches. 

= 3.3 SPECIFICATIONS VIEW FOR ITEM PAGE = 
Like Options UI(swatches), Specification View feature of BUNDLOICE (formerly Woo Choice Plugin) is also an important tool for WooCommerce sites, its use cases are different but when you are searching for a customizable product addon tool to replace default woocommerce additional information view or specification view than this feature can be of help. If your product has many informative attributes e.g. diamonds or for any other inventory item that matters then specification view feature is useful to present attributes nicely in the Additional Information tab of the WooCommerce item page.

= 3.4 SHORTCODE FILTERS FOR WOOCOMMERCE = 
When you have a specific requirement to use the filter on any page you can use shortcode filters module to create search filters on any page and redirect to your desired target page or to the same page. When you have the requirement to create any kind of basic or advanced woocommerce product filters then this module is for you.

In many such scenarios, shortcode filters are useful.

  * Filter by any WooCommerce Category
  * Filter by any WooCommerce Product Price

So you can update all the product’s price at once and this plugin allows you to set the margin percentage as per your wish. This is not all, say you want to update prices for some large/small groups of products say products that belong to some categories or attributes this plugin will enable you to do just that.
