Product bundling as ring builder for jewelry, pair maker for clothing, grocery and guidance tool for home decor, cosmetics etc. <br/>

## Description ##
WooCommerce Product Bundle Choice - also known as WBC helps you create product bundles with the following features:

1.   Ring Builder
1.   Pair Maker
1.   Jewelry Customization
1.   Bulk update Price (Any type of Inventory)

We also have Rapnet Extension.

It does not matter to which category your website belongs to, if you are selling anything that you think can be sold in a pair/bundle then this plugin is absolutely for you.

We provide both the features in a single plugin but ring builder feature will be useful for you if you have a jewelry/diamond website like lab grown or CVD diamond and pair maker feature will be useful for you if you have anything that you think can be sold in a pair like fashion, apparel, household items - anything etc.

In short, it supports every kind of inventory.


## UNDERSTANDING FEATURES ##

### 1. RING BUILDER ###
This ring builder feature means online virtual designing of any jewelry item on the screen itself. For example, you are selling cvd diamond or lab grown diamonf online, then the customer step by step combines a pair of – firstly ring setting/mount with diamond and so on. This way combining pair with different parts creates a complete product or pattern.[See a Demo](http://cvddiamond.xyz/product-category/solitaire/?EO_WBC=1&BEGIN=solitaire&STEP=1)

### 2. PAIR MAKER ###
For example, you are selling clothes online then the customer after selecting top-wear is guided for the bottom wear automatically. So if by chance, user is confused then the plugin guides by mixing and matching different alternatives from the stock and thus pair of clothing is created for the customer. [See a Demo](http://101.53.136.134/demo/yc_textile/)

### 3. JEWELRY CUSTOMIZATION ###
Fully customizable options available. Here, fully customization means when the user selects any particular jewelry item then he gets a ton of customization options available in front of him/her like how many carats of gold would they prefer? What exact color of jewelry do they want? and the list goes on...

### 4. BULK PRICE UPDATE ###
It is obvious that any e-commerce website has many products. And the vendors like to keep equal profit margins on all products - around 20%. So you can update all the product's price at once. This feature is best for jewelry website owners as the price of gold keeps on fluctutating, they can update unnumerable jewelry item prices at once.
