the "templates" folder is now supported to hold all the template files 

so the first place to look for any of the templates is plugin-root/templates folder 

however still the admin templates are supposed to reside at the default location of view folder as per the MVC style, so for admin templates always look at the plugin-root/application/view folder 

lastly, it is important to note that in cases where the templates of frontend widgets are not moved from the view folder then those can be found at the default location plugin-root/application/view directory
