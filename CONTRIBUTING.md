# Contributing to BUNDLOICE(formerly WOO CHOICE PLUGIN)
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
If you do not have experience of making pull request or if you have any question regarding pull requests then follow below links:

[Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLGobWwA3Y&ab_channel=KeepOnCoding) or
[makeapullrequest.com](https://makeapullrequest.com/) or
[www.firsttimersonly.com](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `ui_QCed_bhavesh_pull_request`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, then below steps.

2.1. Make Changes to the Plugin
     Implement your changes in the plugin's code. This might involve bug fixes, new features, or code improvements.
     Test your changes on a local development environment to ensure they work without errors.

2.2  Create a ZIP File and Upload to Repository
     Once your changes are complete and tested locally, create a ZIP file of the entire plugin folder, including all necessary files and subfolders.
     Open the repository and ensure you are on the ui_QCed_bhavesh_1 branch.
     Upload the ZIP file to this branch, either by replacing the existing plugin files or by adding it as a new commit.
     Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message explaining what changes were made.
     Push your commit to the remote repository to ensure the changes are uploaded and visible to others.
     
2.3  Test the Updated Plugin
     After the changes have been uploaded, download and install the updated plugin ZIP file to a test environment.
     Test the plugin to ensure it installs/updates correctly without errors.
     Conduct various test cases, including both positive scenarios (where things should work) and negative scenarios (where errors could occur).
     Confirm the expected outcomes for each test case to ensure the plugin is functioning as intended.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Respective License of this Git Hub Repository. 
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same License that is under the repository. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/EmptyOps/woocommerce-bundle-choice/issues/)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-bundle-choice/); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Control statement include if, for, while, switch, etc. Control statements should have one space between the control keyword and opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls.
* PHP keywords MUST be in lower case.
* There MUST be one space after and before each operator.

## Code of Conduct



### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [support@sphereplugins.com]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
